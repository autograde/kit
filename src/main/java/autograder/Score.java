//Score is an object used to encode/decode a score from a test or tests. When a
//test is passed or a calculation of partial passed test is found, output a
//JSON object representing this object.
//
//Secret read from the output steam need to correspond to the course identifier
//given on the teachers panel. All other output will be ignored.
//
//With the formula in the Autograder CI the score percentage is calculated
//automatically. Give any max score, then pass on a given score the student
//gets for passed sub test within this the max score. Finally, set a weight
//it should have on the total. The weight does not need to within 100 or a
//percentage. If you want to only give a score for completing a test, then
//MaxScore == Score.
//
//Calculations in the CI follows this formula:
//total_weight    = sum(Weight)
//task_score[0:n] = Score[i] / MaxScore[i], gives {0 < task_score < 1}
//student_score   = sum( task_score[i] * (Weight[i]/total_weight) ), gives {0 < student_score < 1}
